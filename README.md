# cypress-vite
Sample project, as I have issues with this combo at work

## Cypress
Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. It addresses the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.

## Vite
Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts: a dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, and a build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output optimized static assets for production.

## Setup Instructions

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Run Vite

```
npm run dev
